>QUADTEC-101 A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT FROM THE FUTURE.

 

>THE GARDEN CITY ELECTRONIC MUSIC COMMUNITY CREATED A TIMEMACHINE USING RARE TELSA BLUEPRINTS AND WENT INTO THE FUTURE TO GATHER DATA OF THE DAY; SEEKING OUT INSTRUMENTS FROM THE CREATIVE YOUTH OF THE FUTURE. UPON RETURNING TO 2019 THEY BROUGHT THOSE IDEAS TO FILIP PIETRUSZEWSKI TO RE-ENGINEER, DESIGN, AND REALIZE THIS FUTURISTIC INSTRUMENT USING MODERN AND ANTIIQUE TOOLS AT HIS MAD SCIENCE LAB AT CAPITAL CITY TRANSISTOR AND VALVE.
